# A quick and shitty script to solve the problem related to dates of birth, ages and their squares
# as described in numberphile's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99stb2mzspI
# 
# For all yob in range, find all possible values of yob (year of birth)
# such that yob + age = age^2 for a certain value of age
# present solution as a list of tuples
# For example: 1980 + 45 = 2025 = 45^2
# so (1980, 45) is a solution
# f(x, y) => x + y = y^2
