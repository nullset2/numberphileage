# numberphileage
A very simple script to calculate tuples that satisfy this numberphile episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99stb2mzspI

For all yob > 1980 (limit with an upper ending for scope), find all possible values of yob (year of birth)
such that yob + age = age^2 for a certain value of age
present solution as a list of tuples
For example: 1980 + 45 = 2025 = 45^2
so (1980, 45) is a solution
f(x, y) => x + y = y^2
